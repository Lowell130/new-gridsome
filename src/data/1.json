Sharp stones can damage the fabric. A ground sheet will protect the floor from damage and dirt. Avoid erecting the tent in a hollow. Rain water can collect there, which could penetrate into the tent in the worst case scenario. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n If there is a strong wind, you should fasten the tent with additional ropes.

        "Category": "",
        "Description": "The Litetrek III is a 3-person, double wall tent, designed for lightweight trekking in alpine terrain, where protection against severe weather, wind stability, light weight and compact pack size are key. Its three-season spec is optimised for use during the milder months of the year. Wind-tunnel tested for stability at 90 km/h by the Technical University of Munich. Its robust, reliable semi-geodesic, double wall construction puts two layers of fabric between you and the elements, enables full use of space and ensures an optimal balance of weather protection and ventilation. The 100% self-supporting design means that you can pitch without problem on rocky terrain, or at alpine sites where there is not enough space to set up with guy lines and pegs. Alternatively, the anchor points can be extended for more flexibility, for example on snowy terrain. Its very tear-resistant 50D ripstop polyester flysheet is PU-coated to give it a 3,000 mm water column, the floor is made of robust PU-coated 70D ripstop nylon that gives a 5,000 mm water column, while the 66D ripstop polyester inner tent has a mesh and mosquito net entrance. Ventilation is regulated via a rear panel with zippers (which can be operated from both inside and outside) allowing you to adjust the fresh air supply and prevent humidity. In addition, our 3S Speed Set Up Solution with short, flat sleeves and hooks allows you to set up fast and effectively in one pitch. And in good weather or on fine nights, you can go minimalist and pitch the flysheet on its own. See also the weatherproof vestibule for gear storage and cooking, which is integrated into the inner tent, or can be extended as required.",

        "Description": "The Voyager 3EX tunnel tent from Robens is a stable base thanks to features that include the new ripstop polyester outer, flat pole sleeves and Yunan alloy poles. The huge extended porch is perfect for expedition pack storage or for foul weather relaxation that is much appreciated by trekkers and other adventurers. The weight is still low enough that two people might consider it as a spacious option if harsh weather is expected. Low vents assist airflow to minimise condensation.\n\n\n\n Robens Wind Test: [MAX: 140km/h | AVG: 125km/h] The determination of the performance of a Robens tent in wind is based on the knowledge and technique available to Robens at the time of testing. During the test we register the maximum (MAX) speed impact a tent was subjected and the average (AVG) wind speed at which structural instability occurred. This may appear as a broken/deformed pole, or the collapse of the tent and subsequent return to shape when the wind drops. At no point was any form of catastrophic failure experienced up to the maximum wind speed.",

        "Category": "",
        "Description": "The Litetrek II is a 2-person, double wall tent, designed for lightweight trekking in alpine terrain, where protection against severe weather, wind stability, light weight and compact pack size are key. Its three-season spec is optimised for use during the milder months of the year. Wind-tunnel tested for stability at 90 km/h by the Technical University of Munich. Its robust, reliable semi-geodesic, double wall construction puts two layers of fabric between you and the elements, enables full use of space and ensures an optimal balance of weather protection and ventilation. The 100% self-supporting design means that you can pitch without problem on rocky terrain, or at alpine sites where there is not enough space to set up with guy lines and pegs. Alternatively, the anchor points can be extended for more flexibility, for example on snowy terrain. Its very tear-resistant 50D ripstop polyester flysheet is PU-coated to give it a 3,000 mm water column, the floor is made of robust PU-coated 70D ripstop nylon that gives a 5,000 mm water column, while the 66D ripstop polyester inner tent has a mesh and mosquito net entrance. Ventilation is regulated via a rear panel with zippers (which can be operated from both inside and outside) allowing you to adjust the fresh air supply and prevent humidity. In addition, our 3S Speed Set Up Solution with short, flat sleeves and hooks allows you to set up fast and effectively in one pitch. And in good weather or on fine nights, you can go minimalist and pitch the flysheet on its own. See also the weatherproof vestibule for gear storage and cooking, which is integrated into the inner tent, or can be extended as required.",

There are two separate sleeping cubes for the children's home or when friends come to visit. It can also be hung up an inner tent and thus increases the living space. The outer tent with 3000 mm hydrostatic head is first set up and then the inner tent is hooked. This has the advantage that the inner tents remain dry during installation in rainy weather. Colour-coordinated poles to match the red piping in the floor area. The red base strip is highly visible at dusk. The seams are sealed with a waterproof seam tape and provide a better seam tear resistance. The very stable 5 mm steel pegs do not bend even on hard ground. 3 continuous ventilations ventilate the tent for restful sleep and should always be open. The entrance with mosquito net window keeps annoying pests away. The \"Como 4\" offers space for 4 people with luggage. Ideal for young families and camping with friends. Material and item details: outer tent: 100% polyester, PU coated, seam tape, sealed, hydrostatic head: 3,000 mm, inner tent: 100% polyester, breathable floor: 100% PE poles: fibreglass 8.5 and 9.5 mm, assembly dimensions: 470 x 230 x 190 cm, inner tent: 2 x 210 x 140 x 150 cm, weight: 7.6 kg, pack dimensions: 58 x 22 x 22 cm.

With the YELLOWSTONE III VENT you have a well-ventilated night camp on shorter trekking tours, which is safe even on rocky surfaces. During sleep, you can breathe deeply because the YELLOWSTONE Vent is very well ventilated: two roof, door and side vents as well as four large coverable mesh surfaces in the inner tent ensure pleasant circulation. When it is windy and cold, you can easily regulate the air supply. The dome tent is quick and easy to assemble. Thanks to our real dome tent technology, it is also particularly wind stable and very spacious due to the steep ground bars. On warm summer nights you simply set up the inner tent on its own. So you can also reduce your luggage enormously when you travel to warm regions. The tent has two opposite entrances with one apse each.",

        "Description": "Whether in the Norwegian fjäll or on the Mediterranean coast \u2013 with your Skyrocket II Dome, you sleep wherever you want. The dome tent accommodates two people, is super quick to set up and so light that you can carry it comfortably in your backpack. The Skyrocket shines with really good ventilation: thanks to the innovative zip vent door fan and the two openings in the roof area, a fireplace effect is created. So the air in the inner tent can always circulate. This is a clear advantage especially in summer. On rocky ground, the dome construction stands without bracing. In strong wind or rain, you increase stability with the guy ropes. In six inner pockets and a removable ceiling compartment, you can store equipment and small parts and keep an overview.",

        "Description": "Curtain for minibus and van with classic external glass fibre brunner entrada for connection to vehicles with gutter height ranging from 180 to 220 cm. The ENTRADA tent is the ideal solution for those who face the world of travelling camping. Its tunnel shape allows you to make the most of the space/surface ratio for an internal space of 8.4 square meters. The total size of the curtain is 310 x 270 x H210 cm and has two doors, one front and one side, which can be opened and raised to the veranda using the vertical poles (not included in the initial supply). The ENTRADA blind is designed with an excellent fence system, large transparent windows and integrated ventilation openings. The curtain top is made from 100% polyester which gives it a 3000 mm water column. The weight of the tent is 10.5 kg and has a closed size of 74 x Ø 24 cm. The ENTRADA tent is part of the Drive-Away category, i.e. curtains that do not need the constant presence of the vehicle to support themselves; when you want to use your minibus or van, simply unplug the tent from the profile and start to new destinations. All with the usual Brunner quality, your partner for outdoor adventures in motion for 60 years!",

It has a single side door that leads to a generous porch area, with ample space for storage and headroom to sit relaxing during poor weather. The weight is still low enough that two people might consider it as a spacious option if unsettled weather is expected. Front and back vents create air flow to minimise condensation.\n\n\n\n Robens Wind Test: [MAX: 145km/h | AVG: 138km/h] The determination of the performance of a Robens tent in wind is based on the knowledge and technique available to Robens at the time of testing. During the test we register the maximum (MAX) speed impact a tent was subjected and the average (AVG) wind speed at which structural instability occurred. This may appear as a broken/deformed pole, or the collapse of the tent and subsequent return to shape when the wind drops. At no point was any form of catastrophic failure experienced up to the maximum wind speed.",

This is ensured not only by its sturdy and durable DAC poles made of high-quality AL 7001 aluminium, but also by the self-standing, storm-proof construction and the far drawn outer tent. The proven Mark technology ensures that three people will find plenty of freedom of movement and plenty of space for their luggage, rainproof ventilation openings ensure a pleasant indoor climate. A mark would not be a mark if it could not be set up in no time - in addition to the practical outer frame with elastic fixation, the pole pockets on the outer tent ensure this. No cumbersome threading necessary. In addition, the elastic connection from flysheet to poles compensates for the impact of force caused by storm gusts. So that everything remains nice and dry even in long-lasting bad weather, the tent floor is pulled far upwards on the sides. To avoid kicking on each other, the tent has two entrances. Inner and outer tent can be separated together or simply separated and set up individually. The Mark 3P remains a weatherproof classic in the range, which has been perfectly adapted to hard outdoor demands over the years. The Vaude Green Shape label stands for an environmentally friendly, functional product made from sustainable materials.",

The proven Mark technology ensures that three people will find plenty of freedom of movement and plenty of space for their luggage, rainproof ventilation openings ensure a pleasant indoor climate. A mark would not be a mark if it could not be set up in no time - in addition to the practical outer frame with elastic fixation, the pole pockets on the outer tent ensure this. No cumbersome threading necessary. In addition, the elastic connection from flysheet to poles compensates for impact caused by storm gusts independently. So that everything stays dry even in long-lasting bad weather, the tent floor is pulled far upwards on the sides. A tent made for weight-optimised cycling trips or trekking. The Vaude Green Shape label stands for an environmentally friendly, functional product made from sustainable materials.",

The zipper of the tent entrance can also be fixed halfway up to provide better ventilation in warm temperatures. The outer tent is made from Fjällräven's new high-performance TripleRip nylon. The impregnation is fluorocarbon free. his innovative construction consists of two different fabric thicknesses - 20 denier at the top and 40 denier on the more heavily used tent floor in order to combine high robustness with the lowest possible weight.",

        "Description": "After a long day hiking on the trails, rest easy (and comfortably) in the Alvar 3P Tent. This freestanding, 2-person lightweight tent offers plenty of headroom, thanks to the zone pre-bend construction that creates vertical walls and strategic clip placement that adds more interior volume. A seam-taped full-coverage fly, vented canopy, additional guylines, and a catenary-cut floor ensure you'll stay dry and water won't pool inside when you're camping. A lampshade pocket holds your headlamp for nighttime lighting while the interior pockets keep small gear organized. Two D-shaped doors with double-mesh make it easy to get in and out or simply vent for extra airflow on hot nights. Color-coded \"easy-pitch\" clips and poles ensure a quick setup.",
